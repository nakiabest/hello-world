Nakia getting started with GitHub


Hi! My name is Nakia. I've been a nurse for 20 years.
I have a PhD in Nursing and Masters Degrees in Nursing Education and Applied Health Informatics. 
I took a database course in my PhD program, but I want to learn more.
I'm interested in learning more about coding, and plan to take classes.
